## 📖 About

**IARA** is a complete embedded system for planted aquarium automation. It manages:

- **Water Change (TPA)** — automated drain & refill with a 6-state state machine.
- **Fertilization** — scheduled dosing via peristaltic pumps with stock tracking.
- **Filtration** — canister on/off control through an SSR relay (AC power).
- **Safety** — continuous sensor monitoring, watchdog timer, and emergency shutdown mode.

The firmware runs on an **ESP32 DevKit V1** and features an **embedded web dashboard** (React + Vite served via LittleFS), **OLED display**, **DS3231 RTC clock**, and a **serial command interface**.

### Safety-First Loop

```cpp
loop() {
    safety.update();          // 🔴 Highest priority
    if (emergency) return;
    timeMgr.update();
    commands.process();
    schedules.check();
    waterMgr.update();        // Water change state machine
    telemetry.send();
}
```

### 🔄 Water Change (TPA) Flow

The TPA is a 6-state state machine that runs non-blocking inside the main loop. Each state has a configurable timeout for safety.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CANISTER_OFF: startTPA()
    CANISTER_OFF --> DRAINING: 3s settle
    DRAINING --> FILLING_RESERVOIR: level reached
    FILLING_RESERVOIR --> DOSING_PRIME: float switch
    DOSING_PRIME --> REFILLING: 2s mix
    REFILLING --> CANISTER_ON: level reached
    CANISTER_ON --> [*]: COMPLETE

    DRAINING --> ERROR: timeout
    FILLING_RESERVOIR --> ERROR: timeout
    REFILLING --> ERROR: timeout / optical sensor
    ERROR --> [*]: check level → canister ON/OFF
```

| Step | State | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **CANISTER_OFF** | Canister filter is turned off (SSR relay HIGH). Waits 3 seconds for water to settle so the ultrasonic sensor gets a stable reading. |
| 2 | **DRAINING** | Drain pump turns on. Ultrasonic sensor monitors the water level. Pump runs until the target level is reached (e.g. 10 cm drop). Flow rate is measured inline for auto-calibration. |
| 3 | **FILLING_RESERVOIR** | Solenoid valve opens to fill the reservoir with tap water. Float switch monitors reservoir level. Valve closes when reservoir is full. |
| 4 | **DOSING_PRIME** | Peristaltic pump doses dechlorinator (Prime) into the reservoir. Waits 2 seconds for mixing. Stock level is deducted and saved to NVS. |
| 5 | **REFILLING** | Refill pump turns on, pumping treated water from reservoir into the aquarium. Stops when ultrasonic sensor reaches the original level OR optical sensor detects max level (safety cutoff). Flow rate is measured for calibration. |
| 6 | **CANISTER_ON** | Canister filter is turned back on. **TPA cycle complete.** Calibrated flow rates are saved to NVS for next TPA. |

**Safety at every step:**
- Each state has a **dynamic timeout** calculated from calibrated flow rates (`volume / flow × 1.5`). First TPA uses safe defaults: **30s drain, 15s refill**.
- The **optical sensor** acts as a hardware-level safety cutoff during refill — immediate stop regardless of ultrasonic reading.
- **Emergency abort** at any point turns off all actuators and restores the canister filter.
- **On error**, the system checks the water level via ultrasonic before turning the canister back on. If the level is too low (e.g. error during drain), the canister **stays OFF** to avoid running dry and damaging the pump.

## 🛡️ Safety & Reliability

The system is designed with a **safety-first** approach to prevent flooding, equipment damage, and fish loss.

### Software Protections

| Protection | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hardware Watchdog (WDT)** | ESP32 Task WDT with 10-second timeout. If the main loop freezes for any reason, the ESP32 automatically reboots. |
| **SafetyWatchdog** | Runs at highest priority every loop iteration. Detects overflow (optical sensor), emergency conditions, and triggers full shutdown of all actuators. |
| **Non-blocking loops** | All wait states (canister settle, prime mixing) use `millis()` instead of `delay()`, so the safety watchdog keeps running during waits. |
| **State machine timeouts** | Each TPA state (`DRAINING`, `FILLING`, `REFILLING`) has a configurable timeout. Exceeding it triggers an error state and shuts down all actuators. |
| **NVS deduplication** | Prevents double-dosing fertilizers on the same day, even after unexpected reboots. |
| **Emergency shutdown** | `emergency_stop` command turns off ALL actuators immediately. |
| **CPU throttle** | Main loop runs at ~100 Hz (`delay(10)`), preventing overheating and leaving CPU headroom for WiFi/TCP stack. |
| **Pump auto-calibration** | Flow rates measured inline during TPA (Δlevel × litersPerCm / Δtime). Dynamic timeouts = `(volume / flow) × 1.5`. First TPA uses safe 30s/15s defaults. |

### Hardware Recommendations

| Protection | Description |
|---|---|
| **Overflow float switch** | NC (normally closed) float switch at max water level, wired in series with the refill pump power. Cuts the pump physically if water rises too high — independent of firmware. |
| **Flyback diodes** | FR154 on pumps, 1N5822 on solenoid — absorb voltage spikes from inductive loads. |
| **Decoupling capacitors** | 1000µF near ESP32, 470µF near MOSFET module — absorb brownout transients. |
| **Voltage divider (ECHO)** | 5V → 3.3V for JSN-SR04T echo pin — protects ESP32 GPIO. |

## 🖥️ Wokwi Simulation

The project includes full support for [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com) simulation, allowing you to test the firmware **without physical hardware**.

### Prerequisites

1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **Wokwi Simulator** extension installed.
2. [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed in VS Code.

### Step by Step

1. **Build the firmware for the Wokwi environment:**

   ```bash
   pio run -e wokwi
   ```

2. **Start the simulation:**
   - Open VS Code in the project directory.
   - Press `F1` → **Wokwi: Start Simulator**.
   - The simulator will load `diagram.json` and the compiled firmware (`.pio/build/wokwi/firmware.bin`).

3. **Interact with the simulation:**
   - **Water Change Button** (GPIO 15) — press to start the water change cycle.
   - **Fertilization Button** (GPIO 23) — press to trigger fertilizer dosing.
   - The serial monitor will display system logs in real time.
   - Virtual WiFi is enabled (`[net] enable = true` in `wokwi.toml`), allowing access to the web dashboard.

### Wokwi Environment Differences

The `wokwi` environment sets the `-D WOKWI_TEST` flag, which automatically adjusts:

- **Fast timing** — water change cycles use seconds instead of minutes.
- **Smaller volumes** — reduced parameters for quick testing.

### Relevant Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `diagram.json` | Defines the virtual circuit (ESP32, buttons, LEDs, sensors) |
| `wokwi.toml` | Simulator configuration (firmware path, virtual network) |
| `platformio.ini` (`[env:wokwi]`) | Build environment with simulation flags |

## 🚀 Build & Deploy

### Build and flash firmware

```bash
# Build firmware
pio run

# Flash to ESP32
pio run --target upload

# Serial monitor
pio device monitor
```

### Full deploy (Frontend + Firmware)

The `Makefile` automates the full workflow:

```bash
# All at once: build React → upload LittleFS → flash firmware
make all

# Or individual steps:
make build-front     # Build React app (Vite)
make upload-fs       # Upload static files to LittleFS
make upload-fw       # Build and flash C++ firmware
make monitor         # Open serial monitor
make clean           # Clean all builds
```

### Frontend (Web Dashboard)

The web dashboard is a React + Vite + Tailwind CSS SPA located in `frontend/`. After building, static files are copied to `data/` and uploaded to the ESP32 via LittleFS.

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
```
